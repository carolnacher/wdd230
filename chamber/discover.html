          <p>Carnival is the largest popular festival in our country. In Uruguay it has been celebrated since colonial
            times, having transformed from the traditional “barbarian festival” with assaults and street guerrillas
            characteristic of the 19th century, to the “civilized” festival of parades and neighborhood tablados
            consolidated in the 20th century and up to the present day. In Montevideo this festival opens with a parade
            that takes place along 18 de Julio Avenue, in which the main carnival groups participate (parodists, murgas,
            comedians, magazines and troupes of blacks and lubolos), which are part of the Official Contest .</p>

          <p>Two weeks later, the biggest festival of the Afro-Uruguayan community takes place: the Llamadas Parade,
            where the protagonists are dozens of troupes that play and dance to the rhythm of candombe, while they walk
            down Isla de Flores street between the Sur and Palermo neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>During its first decades, carnivals in Uruguay were celebrated with costume balls, water games, horseback
            riding through the city, without the presence of the Afro-descendant community. The Comparsas or Black and
            Lubolos Societies began to join the Carnival parades in the 1870s, but only at the beginning of the 20th
            century incorporating the practice of candombe into their participation. Throughout the 20th century, the
            troupes were consolidated in relation to the Montevideo carnival festivities, also participating in its
            contest and tablados.</p>

          <p>In their beginnings, the Carnival parades covered a long route: they started from Plaza Constitución,
            traveled through several streets of the Old City, passed through 18 de Julio, reached Plaza Cagancha and
            returned to the starting point for another route. Technological advances brought lighting, first gas and
            then electricity, which adorned the avenues with more splendor each year.

            Between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, our Carnival became one of the longest in
            the world, lasting for forty days. Throughout February and part of March the groups perform on neighborhood
            stages called tablados, and in the official competition at the Ramón Collazo Summer Theater.

            Along with the central and traditional activities of the Official Contest, Inaugural Parade, Parade of Calls
            and tablados and neighborhood parades, in recent decades other spaces of great participation have been
            consolidated around the carnival festivities:

            The Samba Schools Parade, held on Av. 18 de Julio the day after the Inaugural Parade.
            The Carnival of Promises, which in the 5 categories of the carnival brings together girls, boys and
            adolescents from various neighborhoods of the capital, participating in various instances that culminate in
            the Official Meeting of Groups at the Summer Theater during the months of December and January.
            The Murga Joven meeting, which brings together dozens of young people between 15 and 35 years old, who are
            part of murga collectives that are presented in two instances, after developing a process of training and
            collective creation through the artistic disciplines that the Murga develops as a popular and traditional
            artistic genre of Montevideo culture.</p>
